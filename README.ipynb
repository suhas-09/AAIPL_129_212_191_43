C's statement that A is a liar would then be true, contradicting A being truthful. Assume B is truthful: Then C is truthful, but C's statement that A is a liar would make A a liar, contradicting B being truthful. Assume C is truthful: Then A is a liar, so A's statement that B is a liar is false, making B truthful, contradicting C being truthful. Thus, no one can be truthful, making D correct.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'C', 'reasoning': 'From the given information, A is opposite D, and F is adjacent to A. B is two seats to the right of E. C is not adjacent to F. By placing A and D opposite each other, and F adjacent to A, we can determine the positions of the others. B is two seats to the right of E, and C is not adjacent to F. This leads to C being between E and B.'}\n",

By placing D and C opposite each other, and F two seats to the right of D, we can determine the positions of the others. Since A is between B and F, and F is two seats to the right of D, B must be to the immediate left of A.'}\n",
      "{'answer': 'C', 'reasoning': 'From the given information, A is directly opposite D, so they are seated across from each other. B is two seats to the left of E, meaning B and E are separated by one seat. C is adjacent to F but not to A, and F is not adjacent to D. By placing the people in a circle and satisfying all conditions, C ends up between B and E.'}\n",
