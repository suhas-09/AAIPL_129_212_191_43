X says, 'Y is a knave.' Y says, 'Z is a knight.' Z says, 'X is a knave or Y is a knight.' If exactly one of them is a spy, who is the spy?",

Since Y is a spy (not a knight), 'Y is a knight' is false, so 'X is a knave' must be true. X's statement 'Y is a knave' would then be a lie, making X a knave. This configuration has one spy (Y), one knight (Z), and one knave (X), satisfying the condition. Other options lead to contradictions."
